// It exists because the same server was written out three times (the shared
// LoopbackListener, MCP's Login and OpenRouter's login) and a fix to one of
// them did not reach the others. http.Server.Shutdown only closes idle
// connections, so a client that has sent part of a request header is active,
// survives the shutdown deadline, and keeps its goroutine and the Serve
// goroutine alive past the end of the flow (#1028). #1051 closed that for
// LoopbackListener; the other two kept the original construction.
