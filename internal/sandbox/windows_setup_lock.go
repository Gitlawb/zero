// ONE SETUP AT A TIME PER SANDBOX HOME.
//
// Setup publishes two things in two operations: the stamp inside the runtime
// tree, written while the capability ACL is applied, and the marker in the
// sandbox home, written last. The runtime lease it holds is SHARED, because its
// job is to keep an exclusive eviction away from the tree, and a shared lease is
// something two setup helpers can both hold. Nothing then ordered them:
//
//	A writes its stamp            B writes its stamp
//	                              B publishes its marker and succeeds
//	A publishes its marker and succeeds
//
// Each write is atomic and the pair is not. The home ends up with one setup's
// marker over another setup's tree, and compensation has the same problem in
// reverse: a setup that fails late puts back the snapshot it took at the start,
// over whatever a second setup committed in between. Reported by @jatmn.
//
// The ordering that is missing is between whole transactions, so that is what is
// locked: from before the first thing setup records about the previous state
// until after the marker is published or every compensation has run. The lock
// lives in the sandbox home because the marker does, and the marker is the half
// of the pair there is exactly one of per home. It is a file lock, held through
// an open handle, because the two setups are two elevated helper PROCESSES: a
// mutex inside one of them orders nothing.
//
// Commands do not take it. They read the pair after a setup has returned, and
// serializing every sandboxed command behind a lock file would be a cost with no
// bug behind it.
