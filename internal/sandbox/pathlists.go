// The daemon-token pathname contract
//
// Every layer that interprets ZERO_DAEMON_REMOTE_TOKEN_FILE must agree on the
// SAME bytes, or one layer protects a pathname a different layer never checks.
// Each round of review on this surface came from a new place that disagreed, so
// the rule is written down once here:
//
//  1. The env value is pathname DATA, not a word. Only an all-whitespace value
//     counts as unset (remotetoken.SelectedFilePath). It is never trimmed,
//     never shell-split, and "~" is never expanded — os.ReadFile, the daemon's
//     own reader, treats it literally.
//  2. The token source carries two identities: the operator-configured absolute
//     spelling and the object resolved at daemon startup. Both remain protected;
//     resolving never overwrites the only configured identity.
//  3. Tool arguments are compared as EXACT bytes, because that is what the tool
//     opens (aliasedStringArg does not trim). requestPaths gates on the exact
//     argument. Filesystem-derived case equivalence is applied only by the final
//     containment comparison; it does not rewrite the argument bytes.
//  4. Protection is NOT re-includable. AllowRead, a permission grant, and a
//     session profile all leave it in place, on every platform.
//
// A new consumer of the token pathname belongs on one of these four rules. If
// it needs a fifth, the contract is what changes — not just that call site.
//
// protectedCredentialPaths returns credential files that Zero's own in-process
// file tools must never read or modify, independent of Policy.
//
// The shared token source retains the operator-configured absolute spelling and
// the object resolved at daemon startup. The former reserves the authority
// boundary across replacement and restart; the latter protects the bearer object
// currently held by the daemon. A non-daemon caller without the resolved marker
// resolves the current target best-effort.
