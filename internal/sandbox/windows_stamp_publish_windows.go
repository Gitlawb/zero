// ONE STEP FROM THE OLD STAMP TO THE NEW ONE.
//
// Commands and zero doctor read the stamp without taking the setup lock. The
// writer used to open the existing stamp with FILE_OVERWRITE_IF, which truncates
// at open time, and only then protect and write it, so a command validating in
// that interval read an empty or partial stamp and refused to start on a setup
// that was still valid, and a process that stopped there left the marker
// pointing at a stamp that could never validate again. Rollback had the same
// interval the other way round: it removed the stamp before recreating the
// previous one. The setup lock orders setup helpers; it cannot protect readers
// that never take it. Reported by @jatmn.
//
// So the new contents are written complete into a fresh file beside the stamp,
// created with the stamp's protected DACL already in place, and that file is
// renamed over the stamp through its own handle. A reader opens the old stamp or
// the new one and nothing in between, and a process that stops anywhere before
// the rename leaves the previous stamp exactly as it was, plus an unreadable
// replacement file nothing looks for.
//
// POSIX rename semantics are what let the replacement land while a reader has
// the old stamp open, and only for a reader that opened it with
// FILE_SHARE_DELETE, which readWindowsSandboxRuntimeStampFile does. os.ReadFile
// does not, and os.Rename's replace is refused against an open destination
// whatever its share mode, so neither is used here. A reader that holds the
// stamp without share-delete, such as an older Zero, gets a short bounded retry
// and then a failed setup with the previous stamp untouched.

// windowsRuntimeStampPublishSeam runs once the replacement is complete and
// before it replaces the stamp, which is the one point where a stopped process
// leaves both files behind. Nil in production.
