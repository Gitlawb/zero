// THE UNPARSEABLE FALLBACK MUST BE A SUPERSET OF WHAT THE AST PATH FLAGS.
//
// The POSIX parser rejects shell syntax the invoked shell accepts, and the
// analyzer names Windows command strings as exactly that fallback case. When a
// command form loses its network category by being written in a spelling the
// parser cannot read, the approval gate disappears for it — and on Windows that
// approval IS the egress control, because there is no namespace or seatbelt
// underneath it.
//
// The serving forms were briefly dropped from the fallback on the reasoning that
// they bind rather than fetch. The AST path sets Network for them anyway, and
// says why: nothing consumes LocalServer yet, and `npm run dev` is matched by
// script name, so the repository decides what `dev` and `predev` do and either
// can reach out before a port is bound.
