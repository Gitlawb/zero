// into, which the no-follow open of that directory refuses. This one puts it
// ABOVE a component that does not exist yet, which is the case the refusal never
// saw: os.MkdirAll walked the pathname, followed the junction, and created the
// missing component on the other side of it as Administrator. The no-follow open
// that came next then found a perfectly ordinary directory at the requested
// pathname, because the caller-controlled redirection had already happened one
// level up, and the elevated write landed outside the sandbox home.

// A junction rather than a symlink for the same reason as the sibling test: it
// needs no privilege, so it is reachable by exactly the unprivileged user this
