// restricting-SID list both allow it. The principal's account SID is already
// enabled in its normal token, so listing it as a restricting SID makes the
// second check a formality for anything granted to that account: every path
// carrying a direct principal ACE passes both halves and is writable wherever it
// sits, including the profile directory Windows creates on first logon outside
// every configured write root.
//
// Same shape as the World SID in the restricted list (#865). A SID already
// carried by the normal token cannot also restrict it.

// The pre-existing jail test could not catch this: it grants a GROUP
// (WinBuiltinGuestsSid), so it exercises a configuration the product never
// ships. This asserts the composition that actually ships.
