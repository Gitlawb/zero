// windowsExecutionReport is the helper's side channel back to the parent.
//
// The only fact it carries is whether the REQUESTED process was created. The
// parent starts this helper, so the parent's own exec.Cmd.Process proves the
// helper ran and nothing more: setup-marker validation, ACL application,
// network-policy validation, capability and offline SID construction and
// restricted-token creation all happen afterwards and can each return with no
// sandboxed child. Only this process observes the transition, so only this
// process may report it.
//
// OPENED BEFORE THE LAUNCH, ON PURPOSE. Publishing is not free of failure, and
// once CreateProcessAsUser has succeeded a running child exists whether or not
// the report can be written. Acquiring the file first moves every failure that
// can be moved to a point where there is still nothing to own; what remains is
// handled by reaping the child rather than returning while it runs.

// on, and what ResolveChildLaunched treats as authoritative. It is deliberately
// NOT "CreateProcessAsUser returned a handle": a suspended process that is reaped
// before ResumeThread has executed no instruction and applied nothing, and a
// report saying otherwise would disclose a write-jail trade nobody made.
//
// Publish before resume stays, because it closes the inherited-pipe race the
// caller documents. What this adds is the other half: a resume failure retracts
// the record, so the report stops saying true about a child that never ran.
//
// RETRACTED, NOT DELETED. The publication is readable for as long as the window
// between it and the resume lasts, and the parent reads it live: a poll landing
// in that window latches a launch, and that latch outlives the file, because a
// normal cleanup deletes the report too and the parent must not read that
// deletion as a child that never started. Deleting on this path would therefore
// leave the latched positive standing in both the live and the final result. An
// explicit false is the one answer that revokes it, so the returned flag keeps
// the file when the retraction was written. If it could not be written the file
// is discarded after all, which is no worse than before.
