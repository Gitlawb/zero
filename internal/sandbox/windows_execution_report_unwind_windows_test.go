// A REPORT THAT SAYS A CHILD LAUNCHED HAS TO MEAN THE CHILD COULD RUN.
//
// The report is published before ResumeThread so the inherited-pipe race is
// closed, and that ordering is right. But a failure between the publish and the
// resume reaps a process that executed nothing, and the report was left on disk
// saying true. AppliedEnforcementNotices gates on that report, so the operator
// would have been told a write-jail trade applied to a child that never became
// runnable. The record has to be unwound on that path, not only on the ones
// before it was written.
// AND IT HAS TO SAY SO, RATHER THAN SAY NOTHING. Removing the file leaves the
// parent reading absence, which is also what a normal cleanup leaves, so a
// reader that saw the publication during the window keeps its positive through
// completion. The retraction states the negative instead.
