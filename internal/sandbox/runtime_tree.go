// prepareSandboxRuntimeTree creates and secures the runtime root's own
// directories through a handle on the root, and refuses any that is a link.
//
// THE CHILDREN ARE THE SANDBOX'S TO CHANGE. The root is a write root: every
// backend grants or binds it read-write so a sandboxed command can use its TMP
// and caches, and that same grant lets the command remove cache, data or tmp
// and leave a link to a host directory in its place. The tree outlives the
// command, and the fallback root is derived rather than minted, so the NEXT Zero
// process prepares the same tree, unsandboxed. It used to MkdirAll and Chmod each
// child by pathname after checking only the root and its ancestors, which
// followed the planted link: a contained command could get Zero to create npm
// inside a host directory and change that directory's mode. Reported by @jatmn.
//
// So nothing below the root is reached by pathname. os.Root resolves every
// component relative to the root's handle and refuses one that leads out of it,
// which covers the parent of every grandchild too; a child that is a link at
// all is refused outright, because nothing but tampering puts one there; and
// the mode is set on the opened directory rather than on a name that could be
// swapped between the check and the change.
