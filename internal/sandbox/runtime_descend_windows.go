// createRuntimeTailHandleRelative creates the owned tail of the runtime root
// beneath base, one component at a time, from retained handles.
//
// THE NAME IS NOT AUTHORIZATION. The previous shape found the deepest existing
// ancestor with os.Stat and then created each missing component by opening its
// parent BY NAME. Both follow a junction, so a local user could replace the
// predictable owned "zero" component with a junction after the pre-check,
// point it anywhere, let elevated setup create runtime\v1\<hash> beneath that
// target, and put the original back before the post-check. The post-check then
// saw an ordinary path, the plan applied normally, and rollback reported the
// separately created target only as identity-mismatched residue.
//
// So the base is opened by name exactly once, and everything below it is
// addressed relative to a handle with FILE_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT: an existing
// component is opened no-follow and refused if it is a link, and a missing one
// is created relative to its parent's handle and identified from the handle the
// create returned. No component name is resolved twice, so there is no interval
// for a swap to land in, and a junction placed at any owned component is seen
// as the link it is rather than followed.
//
// Redirected cache and TEMP locations ABOVE the owned tail are still allowed:
// they are part of base, which is the operator's business. The restriction is
// on the zero/runtime/v1/<hash> components Zero itself owns.

// the descent just verified, which is the whole interval this design removes.
