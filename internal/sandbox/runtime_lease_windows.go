// objects: setup or a running command held a shared lock on the link, cleanup
// took an exclusive lock on its target, both calls succeeded, and cleanup went on
// to RemoveAll a root somebody was still using.

// Mutual exclusion is a property of the OBJECT, so cleanup resolves the name the
// way acquisition does and refuses the same reparse objects.
