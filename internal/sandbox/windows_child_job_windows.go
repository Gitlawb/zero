// THE SUSPENDED CHILD NEEDS AN OWNER THAT OUTLIVES A KILLED HELPER.
//
// The helper publishes the launch fact and only then resumes, which is what
// makes "no report" mean "nothing ran" rather than a race (see
// publishThenResume). Creating the child suspended is what buys that, and it
// also creates a state nothing else in the helper covers: between
// CreateProcessAsUser and ResumeThread the child exists, holds the inherited
// stdin/stdout/stderr handles, and cannot execute a single instruction.
//
// Hook and plugin commands reach this through Engine.CommandContext, which uses
// the default exec.CommandContext cancellation: on timeout or cancel the helper
// is killed outright. It cannot run its deferred cleanup, cannot reach
// terminateSuspendedWindowsChild, and cannot resume. Windows does not terminate
// a child because its parent died, so the suspended process survives holding the
// pipe write ends, and a parent still reading them waits on a process that will
// never write and never exit.
//
// A job object with kill-on-close is the only mechanism that survives the
// helper being terminated rather than unwound: the kernel enforces it. The job
// is created and the helper joins it BEFORE any child exists, so every child
// created afterwards inherits membership at creation and there is no window in
// which a child is alive and unowned. TerminateProcess on the helper closes the
// last handle, and the kernel kills the job.
//
// Deliberately not solved with exec.Cmd.WaitDelay in the parent: that releases
// the caller while the orphan keeps running and keeps the pipes, which trades a
// visible hang for an invisible leak. It is a reasonable backstop, not the fix.
//
