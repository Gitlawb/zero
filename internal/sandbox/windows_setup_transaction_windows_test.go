// machine-wide state, is replaced. Everything this contract is about still runs
// for real: the setup lock, the lease, provisioning, the snapshot, the ACL apply
// with the stamp riding on its handle, the marker, and every compensation.
//
// The WFP seam is also the barrier. It sits exactly between the two halves of
// the pair setup publishes: the stamp is already on disk when it runs and the
// marker is not written until it returns.
