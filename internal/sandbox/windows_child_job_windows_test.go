// THE OWNERSHIP HAS TO BE TESTED FROM OUTSIDE THE PROCESS THAT OWNS IT.
//
// joinWindowsChildKillJob puts the CALLING process into a job with
// kill-on-close, which is the whole point: when the caller is terminated its
// handle closes and the kernel takes the children down with it. A test that
// calls it in-process and then closes the handle therefore terminates the test
// binary. That is exactly what the first version of this file did: `go test`
// printed "ok", exited 0, and the assertions after the close were never
// reached. Worse, the package's remaining tests never ran either, because the
// binary was gone, and nothing anywhere said so.
//
// So everything below drives a SEPARATE process: the test binary re-executed as
// the helper below. It calls the production joinWindowsChildKillJob, creates a
// suspended child the way the sandbox helper does, and parks. The test is then
// free to kill it and ask what happened, which is the question.
