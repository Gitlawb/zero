// headLimit bounds a discovery-time read of a transcript.
//
// Discovery lists sessions; it must never pay for their contents. A working
// machine here holds 439 MB of Claude Code transcripts across 1,266 files, one
// of them 73 MB on its own, so "just parse it and take the first few fields"
// turns `sessions discover` into something nobody runs twice.
//
// All three bounds are needed, and MaxBytes is the one that actually saves us:
// a single transcript line can be megabytes (one large tool result), so a
// line-count bound alone would still stream the whole file looking for the 64th
// newline. MaxBytes is enforced by an io.LimitReader around the file, which
// caps bytes pulled off disk regardless of where the newlines fall.

	MaxLines     int
	MaxBytes     int64

// defaultHeadLimit is sized from the real corpus, and MaxBytes in particular was
// set by measurement rather than by taste.
//
// Across sampled Claude Code transcripts the record carrying cwd/gitBranch/
// sessionId is line 3 and the ai-title record line 8, so 64 lines is ample. The
// byte budget is the subtle one: it is a budget for the whole scan, so a single
// outsized record spends it and starves the records after it. Three real
// sessions in a 269-file corpus open with a ~334 KB queue-operation record and
// were dropped entirely at a 256 KiB budget — the scan never reached line 3.
//
// 2 MiB clears that case with room to spare while still bounding a 73 MB
// transcript to a ~36x smaller read. The budget only ever binds on pathological
// files; a normal transcript's first 64 lines are a few KB in total and the line
// count ends the scan long before the bytes do.
// importLineLimit is the per-record cap for a FULL import, which is a
// deliberate one-off read of one file the user named — not the index's sweep of
// every transcript on disk. The discovery cap is 64 KiB because it is paid once
// per file across the whole store; applying it to an import silently deleted
// ordinary long messages from the conversation being restored. Still bounded, so
// a corrupt file cannot exhaust memory.
