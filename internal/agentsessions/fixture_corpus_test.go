// The TestTheReal*CorpusStillParses tests pin the on-disk FORMAT, but only on a

// the real adapters at a checked-in fixture store under testdata via the same
// redirect variables production honours (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME), so the
// format-pin runs deterministically and never skips. A shape change upstream
// fails a test here instead of silently emptying a picker in front of a user.

// WHY THESE FIXTURES EXIST. The TestTheReal*CorpusStillParses tests below assert
// STATISTICS over whatever store the machine running them happens to have, and
// that is not a property of this package. The same code reported "44 of 44
// rollouts, 43 with a model" and "360 of 367 transcripts" here while a reviewer
// with a smaller store got "0 with a model" and "15 of 21 (71%)" and a red
// build. Green for CI, red for the contributor, and the shapes that actually
// caused it were never written down anywhere a test could find them.
//
// These pin the two shapes by construction, so the behaviour is checked on every
// machine and a change to it fails here rather than in a reviewer's terminal.

// A SESSION WITH NO cwd ANYWHERE IS NOT INDEXABLE, and that is correct. cwd is
// only ever carried by user, attachment and system records; the preamble types
// (queue-operation, last-prompt, mode, permission-mode, bridge-session) never
// carry it. A transcript that never reached its first user turn therefore has no
// workspace to bind to, and a picker row for it could not be resumed anywhere.
//
// This is the whole of the gap on the machine this was written on: all 7 of the
// 367 unindexed transcripts were single-record bridge-session stubs.

// A WORKSPACE SURVIVES AN OVERLONG RECORD, at every size.
//
// This test has been wrong twice and the history is worth keeping. It first
// asserted the workspace "is still found" using a 1 KiB record against a 64 KiB
// cap — 64x under the boundary it was named for, so it only reacted if the
// production constant was cut to 512. @Vasanthdev2004 measured what actually
// happened (1 KiB indexes, 60 KiB indexes, 70 KiB does not, 200 KiB does not)
// and it was the opposite of the name.
//
// It was then renamed to pin the loss honestly. CodeRabbit's answer to that was
// the better one: recover the metadata instead of documenting its absence.
//
// THE MECHANISM. A record over MaxLineBytes still arrives as a prefix, and the
// fields discovery needs — cwd, the branch, the timestamp — sit at the FRONT of
// the object, before the message body that made it oversized. topLevelStrings
// reads them off the prefix with a token stream that stops cleanly at the cut,
// so what it recovers was genuinely complete and genuinely top-level. The body
// is still discarded, which is the whole point of the cap.
//
// This mattered on the real corpus: the opening user record is already over the
// cap in 30 of 367 transcripts here, and 73 of the 360 indexed sessions (20%)
// were taking their cwd from a following attachment record purely by luck. One
// without that rescue disappeared.
