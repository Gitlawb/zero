// transcript across four stores. That is affordable once, but /resume is opened,
// dismissed and reopened constantly, and paying it on each keypress makes the
// TUI hitch every time.
//
// Ten seconds is chosen to be shorter than a person can act on the staleness. A
// session finished in another terminal appears on the next open rather than
// this one; the alternative — no cache — makes every open hitch to avoid a case
// nobody notices.
