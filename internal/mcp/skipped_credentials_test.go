// THE CONTEXT THAT MAKES AN ERROR SAFE IS RECORDED WHERE THE ERROR IS PRODUCED.
//
// A skipped entry keeps the RAW failure, and the surface that displays it
// redacts it against whatever the token store holds at that moment. So the
// consumer has to know whether that set is still the one that was hiding the
// credential, and the only place that can answer honestly is registration.
//
// Sampling at the consumer is too late twice over. Startup registers here and
// the interactive surface is built afterwards, so a refresh or a logout in
// between is invisible; and the connect attempt that PRODUCED the error can
// itself rotate the store, because a 401 triggers a refresh and the error text
// captured on that attempt can contain the bearer that was just replaced. The
// sample therefore has to be taken before connecting, not after: getting it
// wrong in that direction means the consumer compares the new set against
// itself, finds no change, and prints an error containing a bearer that is no
// longer a candidate anywhere.
