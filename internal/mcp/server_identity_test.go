// Trimming means "docs" and " docs " are two config keys and one runtime
// server, and everything downstream keys on the runtime name: tool accounting,
// the skipped-server observations the panel renders, and invalidation. Two rows
// then share one failure and report the same state, with Go map iteration
// deciding which configuration survives.
//
// It is also a confidentiality problem rather than only a wrong status. Each row
// redacts that shared error with its OWN configuration, so if the server that
// actually failed echoed a credential, the other row does not have that value
// among its candidates and prints it.
