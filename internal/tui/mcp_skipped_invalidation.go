// adoptMCPConfig replaces the in-session MCP config and drops the startup
// failures that are no longer about anything.
//
// A SKIPPED ENTRY IS AN OBSERVATION ABOUT A PARTICULAR SERVER, NOT ABOUT A NAME.
// m.mcpSkipped is written once, at construction, from the startup registration.
// Every successful /mcp command and the add wizard replaced m.mcpConfig and
// refreshed the view while leaving that snapshot untouched, and failures are
// matched by name alone. So removing a failed "docs" endpoint and adding a
// different URL under the same name made the replacement inherit the dead
// endpoint's error and its failed state, and that false result was written into
// the command transcript as well as the panel.
//
// Nothing in the TUI re-registers MCP tools, so the replacement is not running
// either. That does not make "failed" honest: it is reported as having failed
// for a reason belonging to a server that no longer exists, which sends the
// operator to debug the wrong thing. Dropping the observation leaves the row
// reporting configuration, which is what it can actually know.

// DISABLED ENTRIES ARE EXCLUDED, because registration excludes them
// (NormalizeConfig skips raw.Disabled) and an observation is about a server that
// actually ran. ValidateUniqueNames deliberately accepts an enabled "docs"
// alongside a disabled " docs" for that reason. Copying both into a map keyed by
// the trimmed name made them collide, and Go randomises map iteration, so the
// before and after snapshots each picked a winner independently. An unrelated
// /mcp operation that left the enabled entry untouched could then compare it
// against the disabled alias, find them different, and discard the failure: a
// server that is still unavailable reported as fine, on some runs and not others.
// Measured at 20% of runs on an unchanged config before this.
//
// A canonical name claimed by two ENABLED entries is ambiguous rather than
// arbitrary. ValidateUniqueNames rejects that config so it should not arrive
// here, but if it does there is no way to say which entry an observation was
// about, so the name is dropped and the observation ages out with it.
