// AN OBSERVATION'S OWN CONTEXT OUTRANKS THE ONE SAMPLED AT THE SURFACE.

// registered these failures and after everything that runs in between could
// have rotated the store. Comparing against that sample asks "has anything
// changed since I started rendering", which is always no, instead of "is the
// material that made this error safe still here".

// away during startup, the surface-level sample matches the current store
// exactly, the row is rendered, and the redaction candidates no longer contain
// the bearer that is sitting in the text.
