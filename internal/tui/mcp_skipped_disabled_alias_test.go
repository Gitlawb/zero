// " docs": a disabled entry claims no runtime identity. canonicalMCPServers
// copied both into a map keyed by the trimmed name, so they collided, and Go
// randomises map iteration. The before and after snapshots each picked a winner
// independently, so an unrelated /mcp operation that left the enabled entry
// untouched could compare it against the disabled alias, find them different, and
// discard the failure. A server that is still unavailable was then reported as
// fine, on roughly one run in five.
