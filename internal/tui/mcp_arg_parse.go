//
// The failure collector, the Target row and the URL collector each decided
// where a flag ends and its value begins, separately, and each did it by
// cutting at the first "=". That is only the boundary when the "=" comes before
// any whitespace. In "--api-key YWJjZGVmZ2hpag==" and
// "-HX-Workspace-Id: YWJjZGVmZ2hpag==" the first "=" is base64 padding inside
// the credential, so the cut kept "=" as the value and left the recoverable
// body outside the redaction set, while the Target row printed that body
// followed by "=[REDACTED]". Reported by @jatmn.
//
// The boundary is found here, before anything inside the value is interpreted,
// and all three consumers read the same result.

// mcpArgParts is one element split at the boundary between a flag and the value
// it carries in that same element.
