// runSandboxExec runs ONE command through the real sandbox and exits with its
// status.
//
// This exists because until now the sandbox could only be exercised through a
// full agent turn with a model in the loop. `zero sandbox policy` reports what
// the posture would be and `zero sandbox check` evaluates a hypothetical
// decision, but nothing actually ran a command and let you look at what
// happened on disk afterwards. The practical result is that enforcement is
// covered almost entirely by tests asserting the shape of an ACL plan, and
// almost not at all by tests asserting a write was refused.
//
// A plan can be perfectly correct and never reach the filesystem. That is not
// hypothetical here: the .git rename guard was emitted correctly by the planner
// and silently skipped by the applier, and four tests covering the plan all
// passed while the ACE was absent from disk. Something that runs the real
// binary and then stats the file is the only thing that catches that class.
//
// Deliberately NOT a debug curiosity: it takes the same path a shell tool
// takes, the engine's decision first and then the engine's command plan, so
// what it proves is what users get. It prints the decision, then the resolved
// backend and enforcement level, to stderr before running, so a harness can
// assert the sandbox was actually engaged rather than quietly downgraded.

Runs one command through the real sandbox and exits with its status.

Everything after the -- separator is the command, so its own flags are not
parsed as Zero's. The command is evaluated the way a session evaluates a shell
tool call before anything is planned: the decision is written to stderr, and a
command a session refuses is refused here too, with the same reason. Running it
from a terminal counts as the approval a session would prompt for, and lifts
only what that approval lifts. The resolved backend and enforcement level are
then written to stderr before the command runs, and a downgrade is reported
there explicitly.

Examples:
  zero sandbox exec -- cmd /c echo hello
  zero sandbox exec -- powershell -Command "Set-Content out.txt x"
