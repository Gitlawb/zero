// THE GRACEFUL PHASE HAS TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN.
//
// The shutdown comments described a graceful signal followed by escalation while
// the code did neither: Cancel called KillProcessTree, which is SIGKILL here, and
// WaitDelay only starts counting after Cancel returns so it could never postpone
// a kill that had already happened. A directed SIGTERM therefore reached the
// child as 137 rather than 143, with no chance to flush output, drop a lock file,
// or run a shutdown handler.
//
// Driven with a child that traps the signal and records that its handler ran, so
// the assertion is about the observed lifecycle rather than about a configured
// duration.
