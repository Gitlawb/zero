// environment: directCommandEnv and scrubSensitiveEnv return a slice they built,
// and that slice is non-nil with length zero when every entry was sensitive.
// Testing its length collapsed the two states and turned the strictest possible
// answer into the loosest one.
//
// Not reachable through `zero sandbox exec` today, because the child environment
// is os.Environ() and an environment holding only sensitive keys has no
// %AppData%, so config resolution fails before the planner runs. Pinned anyway,
// because the next caller that hands the plan a deliberately narrow environment
// would silently inherit everything instead.
