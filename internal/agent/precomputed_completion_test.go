// PRODUCING A RESULT AND ASKING THE RUN TO STOP ARE DIFFERENT FACTS.
//
// closeOutRemaining decides between finalizing a completed sibling and writing
// an aborted placeholder, and it used to make that decision from abortErr. A
// cancelled permission request is exactly where the two facts disagree:
// executeToolCall builds the cancellation result, with its call ID, its message
// and its denial category, and returns it TOGETHER with
// ErrPermissionApprovalCanceled. Reading the error as "never started" discards a
// real result and records the opposite of what happened, and the cancellation
// then goes missing from OnToolResult, the trace counters and the task
// observation even though the permission event already fired.
