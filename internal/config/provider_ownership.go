// Provider identity has three distinct questions, and conflating them is what
// let a mutation aimed at one row land on another:
//
//  1. "Which stored secret is this?" — SameProviderIdentity, the credential
//     store's normalization. Two spellings can share one secret.
//  2. "Which row does this mutator target?" — exact trimmed equality. Persisted
//     writers address rows exactly, because that is what they rewrite.
//  3. "Which persisted row, if any, does this RESOLVED row own?" — this file.
//
// A resolved provider list is a merge of user config, project config, and
// environment discovery, and the merge is exact: user "work" and project "WORK"
// are two rows, not one. Once such a row is flattened into a ProviderProfile,
// its display Name no longer says which layer produced it, so asking question 1
// and acting as if it answered question 3 made "shares a credential identity
// with a user row" mean "IS that user row" — and a delete or edit of the project
// row rewrote the user's.

// ProviderNameLookup is the outcome of resolving a provider spelling against a
// set of candidate row names.

//
// The rule:
//
//   - An exact persisted row is owned outright.
//   - Otherwise, a credential-identity match is a candidate only when exactly
//     one persisted row carries that identity. Several is ambiguous, and a
//     mutation under ambiguity would pick a row at random.
//   - The candidate is REJECTED when another resolved row already carries that
//     persisted row's exact spelling. That row is the user row's own entry in
//     the list; this one is a project or environment row that merely shares a
//     credential identity with it, and it must not write through it.
//
// The last clause is the whole defect: with user "work" and project "WORK" both
// resolved, "WORK" found the sole identity match "work" and edited or deleted it
// — while the in-memory operation targeted exact "WORK", so the row changed on
// disk was not the row changed in the session.
